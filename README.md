# Todo

- Implement a better timeline system. The master track relies on a silent audio file to create a 3 minute timeline for testing. This should be replaced with better logic.

- Multi-track recording

- Solo / Mute

- Implement a maintained branch of recorder.js that supports better recording quality.
